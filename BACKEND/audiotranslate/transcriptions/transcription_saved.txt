 Variables, x equals one, x equals x plus two, what is it gonna print out? X equals three, strings, x, y, take a guess what x plus y is gonna be. There it is. Take a guess what z is gonna be now. We're taking a slice. Looks like that. Functions, we define this function here. Take f of five, guess what it's gonna be? It's seven, because we added two to five. If statements, x is gonna be equal to two. If x plus one equals three, print x. Is this gonna be true? Yes or no, what do you think? Yes, this was true, so it did print x. If you put this equals four, it doesn't print it, because it's false. Loops. For i in range one to 100, this is a fancy way of saying if i is even. So what is this going to print out? Take a guess. Print is out, prints out the even numbers.
